## Description:

A modpack for Minecraft 1.16.5 focused on sticking close to the vanilla spirit/principles while providing the uniqueness you can only get through modding. There's a little something for everyone, no matter what playstyle you enjoy, and is made specifically for playing on the Sorbet (or in a 5-10 people multiplayer environment).
